# Movie-Dataset-Modeling
The aim of this project is to gain some insight about the data for further modeling it to for investigating the profitability of the movies. That is, your job is to predict whether based on some features a movie is profitable or not. Obviously, you need to gain inight about your data, so before modeling it is necessary to do a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis, and then based on your knowledge dive into the modeling phase. After the modeling you will be asked to design a simple recommendation system. Do a little research about different recommendation system schemes (e.g. Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) and design a simple recommender system. The suggest path toward this project is described as follow:
1. Data loading and gain info
2. Data cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data Modeling (Using different ML models)
5. Evaluation
6. Recommender System
